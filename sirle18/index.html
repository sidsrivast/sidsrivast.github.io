	<h3>Overview</h3>
	
	<p>Recent advances in AI and robotics have led to a
	  resurgence of interest in the objective of producing intelligent
	  agents that help us in our daily lives. Such agents must be able
	  to rapidly adapt to the changing goals of their users, and the
	  changing environments in which they operate.</p>
	 
	<p>These requirements lead to a balancing act that most current
	  systems have difficulty contending with: on the one hand, human
	  interaction and computational scalability favor the use of
	  abstracted models of problems and environments domains; on the other
	  hand, generating goal directed behavior in the real world typically
	  requires accurate models that are difficult to obtain and
	  computationally hard to reason with.</p>
	
	<p>This symposium addresses the core research gaps that arise in
	  designing autonomous systems that execute their actions in complex
	  environments using imprecise models. The sources of imprecision may
	  range from computational pragmatism to imperfect knowledge of the
	  actual problem domain. Some of the research directions that this
	  symposium aims to highlight are: <br> 
	  
	  <ul>
	    <li> hierarchical approaches for goal directed autonomy in physically manifested intelligent
	      systems (e.g., robotics)</li>
	    <li>  formalizations for knowledge representation and reasoning
	      under uncertainty for real-world systems and their simulations, including
	      those based on logic as well as on probability theory </li>
	    <li> tradeoffs between model verisimilitude, scalability, and executability in sequential
	      decision making </li>
	    <li> bridging the gaps between abstract models and reality in sequential decision making </li>
	    <li> online model learning and model improvement during execution </li>
	    <li> identifying modeling errors during plan execution </li>
	    <li> integrated approaches for learning representations and execution policies </li>
	    <li> analysis and use of abstractions in autonomous reasoning and execution </li>
	  </ul>

<h3>Invited Talks</h3>

<div class="lead">
<span class="text-success" style="font-style:italic">An Integrated Model of Goal Reasoning</span><br>
<span style="font-style:italic">David Aha, U.S. Naval Research Laboratory</span></div>

<p>Goal reasoning (GR) allows an agent to dynamically reason
about the relative utilities of goals it could pursue, which may result
in changing its active goals. We have studied processes that support GR,
focusing on situation assessment and decision making, and its
application in (simulated and real) deliberative control tasks. I will
present a simple integrated model for GR, review a progression of our
work and how it relates to SIRLE’s themes, and summarize some of our
current research objectives.</p>


<p><span class="text-success">Dr. David Aha</span> leads the Adaptive Systems Section within NRL’s Navy
Center for Applied Research in AI. His research interests include
intelligent (e.g., goal reasoning) agents, planning, case-based
reasoning, explainable AI (XAI), machine learning, and related topics.
He co-organized 35 international events related to these topics (e.g.,
ICCBR-17, AAAI-18 Senior Member Track, FAIM-18 XAI Workshop), launched
the UCI Repository for ML Databases, served as a AAAI Councilor,
co-created the AAAI Video Competition, received 5 publication awards,
and gave the IAAI-17 Engelmore Memorial Lecture. He has led 4 DARPA
(e.g., XAI) or ONR evaluation teams. His group regularly hosts
post-doctoral researchers and many summer visitors.</p><br><br>

<span style="font-style:italic">Jeremy Frank, NASA Ames Research Center</span></div>

<p>We discuss the opportunities for autonomous systems to perform
reflection on their planners by adapting the models used to build
plans. We first describe model-based planning systems, a form of
automated planning system driven by declarative models of the planning
domain. These models include descriptions of the conditions and
effects of actions on the state of the world.  When planning the
activities of cyber-physical systems, the command and data
representation of the system must be formally abstracted to the
actions and states described in the planning system model. When the
execution of a plan either fails or produces unexpected outcomes, the
execution trace can be abstracted and compared to the predicted state
according to the planning model, producing a list of discrepancies;
these discrepancies can then be used to fix the model. This provides
part of a reflection capability, namely, a set of well-formed problems
with the domain model, the abstractions, or both. The challenge lies
in the rest of the reflection capability, namely, a set of techniques
for changing the models or the abstractions. We discuss these
challenges and describe some of the options for addressing them.</p>


<p><span class="text-success">Dr. Jeremy
Frank</span> <span class="text-muted">is the many-times great grandson
of the infamous Dr. Victor Frankenstein; you could say that Artificial
Intelligence runs in the family.  While unable to completely live down
the infamous family name, Dr. Frank has nevertheless managed to bury
the most unsavory parts of his history, and has made a minor name for
himself by writing some obscure papers in the areas of computer
science and AI, while moonlighting as a rocket scientist for a
little-known space exploration agency that resides within a bloated,
Byzentine bureacracy that poorly serves a large Western hemisphere
country. Dr. Frank strives one day to abandon these fruitless pursuits
and give over his time to his passions of writing fiction, birding,
and cooking, but in the meantime, has shown some small skill in
organizing people and fundraising.</span></p>

<p>In other words, <span class="text-success">Dr. Jeremy Frank</span>
is the Group Lead of Planning and Scheduling Group, in the Intelligent
Systems Division, at NASA Ames Research Center. He received his
Ph. D. from the Department of Computer Science, at the University of
California at Davis, in June 1997. He also has a B.A. in Mathematics
from Pomona College.  Dr. Frank’s work involves the development of
automated planning and scheduling systems for use in space mission
operations, the integration of technologies for planning, plan
execution, and fault detection for space applications, and the
development of technology to enable astronauts to autonomously operate
spacecraft. Dr. Frank has published over 50 conference papers, nine
journal papers, and three book chapters, and received over 40 NASA
awards, including the Exceptional Achievement Medal, the Silver
Snoopy, and the NASA Engineering and Safety Center Award.</p>
